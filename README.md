# Group 7 - TARP Project
This is our project for the Technical Answers for Real World Problems Course

The growth of crops requires nutrients and water, and the spread of weeds in the field will compete with crops, especially the seedlings of crops, for limited resources, causing crops to wither or reduce production due to the lack of nutrients or moisture. If we can identify weeds accurately at an early stage, targeted controlling mechanisms can be applied to them, which will improve the efficiency of agricultural weeding. It can be seen that the distinction among various weeds and crop seedlings is essential for agricultural production.

The morphology of crops at the seedling stage is similar to some weeds and is sometimes mistaken for weeds. In addition, for some species of weeds with similar shapes and colors, manual identification requires a lot of experience and consumes a long period of time. Therefore, detecting weeds with images is a challenging problem.

In this project, we will be presenting plant and weed detection using different deep learning techniques like AlexNet, Customised CNN, LeNet, MobileNetV2 and we will be comparing the accuracies of all the techniques and we will be taking the technique which has highest accuracy. Also, we have built a web app interface through which farmers can upload the seedlings images and the technique chosen will be detecting the weed from the images.
